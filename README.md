## Bugs Encountered
The main problems incurred included the linking of the MailChimp styling forms that had to be overwritten and restructered so that the application can function properly. This was sorted out by using styling on my side and ensuring that the linking of my page to mailChimp was successful.

## Configuration
To configure this project to your system, you will need a knowledge of git, Github, Mailchimp API, jQuery, JavaScript, and CSS. You may also need a good code editor if you are to edit any lines of code submitted.
## Operating
After cloning the directory to your local machine in a particular directory, it is important that you load the system when the internet is accessible to you since the subscription form uses the third party data storage system which is MailChimp. The fonts used are partly google fonts and they may not load up well if the internet is slow, and you will not experience any if you do not have an internet connection.
